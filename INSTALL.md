# How to use

A command with a certain prefix !fc-init will prompt the bot into creating a formatted message which one particular user can interface with. This window will expire after
3 minutes of inactivity.

Users can upload images/text to link to a flashcard with a command, after the user is done with the command, the image and command gets deleted to prevent channel clutter and the image/text is reuploaded to a separate content base, maybe another discord channel for free hosting. Max image size and text length of discord non-nitro default. 

The rest of the mechanics will reference anki for the flashcard aspect.
